In my projects, I leverage GitHub for version control and collaboration. This allows me to track changes, manage different versions of my code, and work seamlessly with others. Additionally, I plan to utilize cloud computing services, such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform, to scale my data analysis projects efficiently and handle large datasets.
